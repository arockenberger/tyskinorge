Conversion Log for files in this repository

Most files were created with office applications like MS Word and MS Excel or with Google Docs and Googel Spreadsheets.
This means that the files have to be converted into open formats that are both human and machine-readable.
In order to document all conversions and modifications to files, the log is used for detailed overviews.


- Manuscript originally written in MS Word (for Mac)
  - created 2017-06-29
  - modified 2017-09-27
  - size: 348 KB
  - file contains text, layout (headings), two charts, footnotes, and comments
- File was stored on private Google Drive.
- File was accessed for further processing on 2019-09-06
- Created copy of .docx file using Google Docs function "File --> Make a copy"
- Converted to Google Docs using conversion function in Google Docs "File --> Save as Google Docs"
- Then downloaded file as .html file (this creates a .zip)
- Unzipped the .zip which unpacks a folder containing the manuscript as a .html file and two images in .png containing the charts
- Changed filename from "CopyofDeutschanNorwegischenHochschulen_201706.html" to "tyskinorge_script.html" (more convenient)
- used ```pandoc`` to convert from .html to .md using the following script

```pandoc tyskinorge_script.html -f html -t markdown -s -o tyskinorge.md```

- moved .md file into "tyskinorge"-repository
- moved .png files (the charts) into "tyskinorge"-repository

- a brief check of the file showed that the comments were not included (likely lost in the conversion from GoogleDocs to .html),
these need to be added to the file in some form
- the check also revealed some layout issues, likely due to the multiple conversions; I think the information loss here is negligible
- TASK: edit tyskinorge_script.md to proper markdown
