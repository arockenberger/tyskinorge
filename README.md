# Tysk i Norge - Deutsch in Norwegen - German in Norway

Data and material for a project analysing the current status of German studies in Higher Education in Norway.

The project was started in 2017 and dropped after a significant change in scope and leaving the university to work for the National Library.

An article was nearly finished but never submitted to a journal.

There is a private Zotero library with material.

I am unsure if I kept the notes and printed material or if I discarded them. If so, I will delete the repo.
